# 🚀 Live Site Orange Money Implementation Guide

This guide provides a permanent solution for Orange Money payments on your live site (dreamexdatalab.com).

## 📋 Solution Overview

The implementation uses an **intelligent fallback system** that:
1. ✅ Tries the API subdomain first (`https://api.dreamexdatalab.com`)
2. ✅ Falls back to a static payment redirect page if API is unavailable
3. ✅ Provides manual payment instructions as final fallback
4. ✅ Handles both successful and manual payment completions

## 🔧 Files Modified/Added

### 1. Updated Registration Page
**File:** `company-complete-registration.html`
- Enhanced API base detection with intelligent fallbacks
- Added connectivity testing before redirects
- Added support for manual payment completion (`?payment=manual`)

### 2. New Payment Redirect Page
**File:** `payment-redirect.html` ⭐ **NEW**
- Tests multiple payment gateway URLs automatically
- Provides manual payment instructions if all gateways fail
- User-friendly interface with retry options

### 3. Existing Fallback Files
**Files:** `payment/success.html`, `payment/cancel.html`, `404.html`
- Already configured to redirect to registration page
- Handle Orange Money portal callbacks

## 🌐 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Upload Static Files to Your Live Site
Upload these files to your `dreamexdatalab.com` root:

```
Website Root/
├── payment-redirect.html          ⭐ NEW - Smart payment handler
├── payment/
│   ├── success.html              ✅ Already created - OM success redirect
│   └── cancel.html               ✅ Already created - OM cancel redirect
├── 404.html                      ✅ Already created - Fallback handler
└── company-complete-registration.html ✅ Updated - Smart API detection
```

### Step 2: Orange Money Portal Configuration
Update your Orange Money merchant portal with these URLs:

**Primary URLs (Recommended):**
- **Success URL:** `https://dreamexdatalab.com/company-complete-registration.html?payment=success`
- **Cancel URL:** `https://dreamexdatalab.com/company-complete-registration.html?payment=cancel`
- **Webhook URL:** `https://api.dreamexdatalab.com/api/payments/webhook`

**Fallback URLs (If needed):**
- **Success URL:** `https://dreamexdatalab.com/payment/success.html`
- **Cancel URL:** `https://dreamexdatalab.com/payment/cancel.html`

### Step 3: Backend Deployment (Optional - Recommended)
For full functionality, deploy the Orange Money backend:

1. **Set up API subdomain:** `api.dreamexdatalab.com` → Your server IP
2. **Deploy backend files** from `orange-money-production/` folder
3. **Configure SSL certificate** for `api.dreamexdatalab.com`
4. **Start Node.js server** on port 8080

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Scenario A: Backend Available ✅
**What happens:**
1. User clicks "Pay with Orange Money"
2. System detects `https://api.dreamexdatalab.com` is reachable
3. Redirects to backend-served Orange Money page
4. User completes payment → Returns to registration with Next button visible

### Scenario B: Backend Unavailable (Current State) ✅
**What happens:**
1. User clicks "Pay with Orange Money"
2. System detects API is unreachable
3. Redirects to `payment-redirect.html`
4. Page tests multiple backend URLs automatically
5. If all fail, shows manual payment instructions
6. User can complete manual payment → Returns to registration

### Scenario C: Manual Payment ✅
**What happens:**
1. User follows manual payment instructions
2. Clicks "continue registration" link: `?payment=manual`
3. Registration page shows "Manual Payment Noted" message
4. Next button becomes available

## 📱 Manual Payment Instructions

When backend is unavailable, users see:

```
Manual Payment Instructions:

2. Select "Pay Merchant" or "Payer Marchand"
3. Enter merchant code: DREAMEX
4. Enter amount: [Amount] GNF
