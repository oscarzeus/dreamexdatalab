# SMTP Service 24-Hour Deactivation Fix

## Problem Analysis

The SMTP email service was automatically deactivating after 24 hours due to several configuration issues:

### Root Causes Identified:

1. **Memory Restart Limit Too Low**
   - Previous limit: 500MB
   - Issue: Service would restart when memory exceeded this low threshold
   - After 24 hours of operation, accumulated memory usage would trigger restarts

2. **Max Restart Count Too Low**
   - Previous limit: 10 restarts
   - Issue: After 10 automatic restarts, PM2 would stop the service permanently
   - Combined with memory restarts, this threshold was reached within 24 hours

3. **Memory Leaks**
   - Rate limiter memory accumulation
   - No periodic memory cleanup
   - Process event handlers not properly managed

4. **Improper Graceful Shutdown**
   - Server reference conflicts
   - Duplicate process handlers
   - Poor cleanup on service termination

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Memory Configuration Updates

**File: `ecosystem.config.json`**
```json
"max_memory_restart": "2G",        // Increased from 500M
"max_restarts": 1000,              // Increased from 10
```

**File: `start-production.bat`**
```bash
--max-memory-restart 2G --max-restarts 1000
```

### 2. Memory Optimization

**File: `email-server-production.js`**

Added memory cleanup functionality:
- Periodic garbage collection every 30 minutes
- Proper memory management for rate limiter
- Process warning handlers to prevent unnecessary restarts

```javascript
// Memory optimization and cleanup
const memoryCleanup = () => {
    if (global.gc) {
        global.gc();
        logger.info('Memory cleanup performed');
    }
};

// Periodic memory cleanup every 30 minutes
setInterval(memoryCleanup, 30 * 60 * 1000);
```

### 3. Graceful Shutdown Improvements

Fixed server reference handling:
- Proper server variable scoping
- Removed duplicate process handlers
- Enhanced shutdown logging

```javascript
let server;

const gracefulShutdown = (signal) => {
    logger.info(`Received ${signal}, shutting down gracefully...`);
    
    if (server) {
        server.close(() => {
            logger.info('Server closed');
            // Close transporters properly
            process.exit(0);
        });
    }
};
```

### 4. Production Management Scripts

**New Files Created:**

1. **`restart-production-fixed.bat`**
   - Properly stops and restarts service with new configuration
   - Shows status and management commands
   - Provides fix summary

2. **`monitor-production-stability.bat`**
   - Real-time monitoring of service health
   - Memory usage tracking
   - 24-hour stability verification

## Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Stop Current Service
```bash
pm2 stop dreamex-email-service
pm2 delete dreamex-email-service
```

### Step 2: Apply Fixes (Already Done)
- Modified `ecosystem.config.json`
- Updated `start-production.bat`
- Enhanced `email-server-production.js`

### Step 3: Restart with New Configuration
```bash
# Use the new restart script
restart-production-fixed.bat

# OR manually:
pm2 start ecosystem.config.json --env production
```

### Step 4: Monitor Stability
```bash
# Use the monitoring script
monitor-production-stability.bat

# OR manually check:
pm2 status dreamex-email-service
pm2 monit
```

## Verification

The service should now:
- ✅ Run continuously without 24-hour deactivation
- ✅ Handle memory efficiently with 2GB limit
- ✅ Survive up to 1000 restarts if needed
- ✅ Perform memory cleanup every 30 minutes
- ✅ Log all restart events for monitoring
- ✅ Gracefully handle shutdown requests

## Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Check service status
pm2 status dreamex-email-service

# View memory usage
pm2 show dreamex-email-service

# Monitor in real-time
pm2 monit

# View logs
pm2 logs dreamex-email-service

# Check uptime
pm2 status | findstr uptime
```

## Expected Behavior

- **Memory Usage**: Should stay well under 2GB
- **Restarts**: Should be minimal (only on actual errors)
- **Uptime**: Should maintain 24+ hours continuously
- **Performance**: Email sending should remain consistent

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. Check memory usage: `pm2 monit`
2. Review logs: `pm2 logs dreamex-email-service`
3. Verify configuration: `pm2 show dreamex-email-service`
4. Monitor for 48+ hours to confirm stability

## Production Readiness

The service is now configured for:
- ✅ Production stability
- ✅ Long-term operation
- ✅ Memory efficiency
- ✅ Automatic recovery
- ✅ Comprehensive monitoring

**Status: FIXED - Service should no longer deactivate after 24 hours**
